# CoffeeScript-example
This is an example of a CoffeScript I have created recently.
It is a small widget loading "the same origin" pages for a product detail page as a modal view.
The idea behind is to improve UX so that users don't need to leave the page to se product details.
Products on the page are the point of refference to the navigation. You can navigate through the pages with the UI built for it.
