# CoffeeScript-example
This is an example of a CoffeScript I have created recently.
It is a small widget loading "the same origin" pages for a product detail page as a modal view.
The idea behind is to improve UX so that users don't need to leave the page to see details of a product.
Products on the page are the point of reference for the navigation. You can navigate through the pages with the UI built for it.

Please note this is not a plugin. This is only a showcase.
